# Manual Netlify Deployment Helper

## Current Build Status: ✅ READY

### Files in dist folder:
- ✅ index.html (main React app)
- ✅ assets/ (JS, CSS, images)
- ✅ manifest.json (PWA config)
- ✅ _redirects (SPA routing fix)

### Deployment Steps:
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the CONTENTS of the 'dist' folder (not the folder itself)
3. Wait for upload and processing
4. Get your new URL (something like: https://random-name-123456.netlify.app)
5. Test the site functionality

### After Deployment:
- Test login functionality
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Verify all routes work (no 404 errors)
- Test the authentication system

### Custom Domain (Optional):
- Once deployment works, you can change the URL to goodschooerp.netlify.app
- Go to Site Settings > Domain Management > Options > Edit Site Name

## Next: Test the temporary URL you receive after deployment!
