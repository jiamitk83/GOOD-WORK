# Netlify Deployment Guide - School ERP System

## Prerequisites

1. **Netlify Account**: Sign up at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. **Git Repository**: Push your code to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
3. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Push to Git Repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Netlify deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com/start](https://app.netlify.com/start)
   - Choose "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your Git provider (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
   - Select your repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: 18

4. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy site"

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy via Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Install Netlify CLI globally
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   
   # Login to Netlify
   netlify login
   
   # Deploy manually
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

3. **Or Drag & Drop**:
   - Go to [netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
   - Drag the `dist` folder to the deployment area

## Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables, set them in Netlify:

1. Go to Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add variables:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Your backend API URL
   - Any other environment variables your app needs

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to Site Settings â†’ Domain management
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS settings as instructed by Netlify

## Build Optimization

The `netlify.toml` file includes:
- **SPA Routing**: Redirects all routes to `index.html`
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, content type sniffing prevention
- **Caching**: Optimized cache headers for static assets
- **Environment Variables**: Production and preview contexts

## Post-Deployment Checklist

1. âœ… Test all routes and navigation
2. âœ… Verify mobile responsiveness
3. âœ… Check PWA functionality
4. âœ… Test authentication flows
5. âœ… Verify API connectivity
6. âœ… Test SimpleBrowser component
7. âœ… Check all CRUD operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails**:
   - Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

2. **404 on Refresh**:
   - Ensure `netlify.toml` has the redirect rule
   - Check publish directory is set to `dist`

3. **API Connection Issues**:
   - Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable
   - Ensure CORS is configured on your backend

4. **Assets Not Loading**:
   - Check if build artifacts are in the correct directory
   - Verify asset paths are relative

## Performance Tips

1. **Enable Branch Deploys**: For testing features
2. **Use Deploy Previews**: For pull request reviews
3. **Enable Form Handling**: If using Netlify forms
4. **Configure Analytics**: Monitor site performance
